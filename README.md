# rpnx-core

A work in progress C++ library that provides cross platform C++ OS abstractions, data structures, and algorithms.

If you use this library, all symbols in the rpnx:: namespace and macros that begin with RPNX_ are reserved for use by the library.

* Windows
* MacOS
* Linux
* Android (NDK)
* FreeBSD

Not currently supported OS:

* Solaris
* iOS
* iPadOS

Supported compilers:

* G++

Not currently supported compilers:

* Emscripten

Unsupported compilers and OS will be supported when possible, so long as they support recent C++ versions. If you want to use one file an issue and I will take a look at it.
